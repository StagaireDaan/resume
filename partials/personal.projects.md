    *Founder and creator*

    [Simresults.net](http://simresults.net) is a website that allows you to
    upload log files from various racing simulators and transforms them into
    a readable format.

    The website is an implementation of a self-developed open-source library
    "Simresults" which is freely available via the website *github*:
    <https://github.com/mauserrifle/simresults>.

    The library is built according to the development method *TDD*, which
    means that all use cases of the API have been fully tested. The API is
    object oriented built and can support multiple simulators with minimal
    modifications.
