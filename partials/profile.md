## Profile

Passionate developer that always feels the responsibility to deliver the best
possible work within factors such as requirements, time, budget and re-usable
code. I am a true perfectionist that is realistic by basing my decisions on
these multiple factors. I like to see every project as an opportunity to
improve both my own and the organization knowledge. I am known for clear
communication and building a bridge between developers and non- developers.

As a developer I do not code without *git*. Hate it when *entities* float
everywhere. I like my *controllers* slim, no more than a link between
*business* and *presentation*. I create *templates* without logic and belief
that the little things like programming with max *80 columns* make a world
of difference.

I have the knowledge to plan, deliver and maintain an entire project with the
help of a passionate front-end developer by my side.
