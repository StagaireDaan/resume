## Profile

Passionate developer that always feels the responsibility to deliver the best
possible work within factors such as requirements, time, budget and re-usable
code. Am a true perfectionist that is realistic within professional environments
by basing my decisions on these multiple factors. I like to see every project
as an opportunity to improve both my own and the organization knowledge. I am
known for clear communication and building a bridge between developers and non-
developers.
