## Profile

Passionate developer that always feels the responsibility to deliver the best
possible work within factors such as requirements, time, budget and re-usable
code. I am a true perfectionist that is realistic within professional
environments by basing my decisions on these multiple factors. I like to see
every project as an opportunity to improve both my own and the organization
knowledge. I am known for clear communication and building a bridge between
developers and non- developers.

    [Simresults.net](http://simresults.net) is a website that allows you to
    upload log files from various racing simulators and transforms them into
    a readable format.

    The website is an implementation of a self-developed open-source library
    "Simresults" which is freely available via the website *github*:
    <https://github.com/mauserrifle/simresults>.

    The library is built according to the development method *TDD*, which
    means that use cases of the API have been tested. The API is object
    oriented built and can support multiple simulators with minimal
    modifications.
