## Profile

Passionate developer that always feels the responsibility to deliver the best
possible work within factors such as requirements, time, budget and re-usable
code. I am a true perfectionist that is realistic by basing my decisions on
these multiple factors. I like to see every project as an opportunity to
improve both my own and the organization knowledge. I am known for clear
communication and building a bridge between developers and non- developers.

As a developer I do not code without *git*. Hate it when *entities* float
everywhere. I like my *controllers* slim, no more than a link between
*business* and *presentation*. I create *templates* without logic and belief
that the little things like programming with max *80 columns* make a world
of difference.

I have the knowledge to plan, deliver and maintain an entire project with the
help of a passionate front-end developer by my side.

## Personal projects

Simresults.net
:   **Website and PHP library**
    \-
    *Founder and creator*

    [Simresults.net](http://simresults.net) is a website that allows you to
    upload log files from various racing simulators and transforms them into
    a readable format.

    The website is an implementation of a self-developed open-source library
    "Simresults" which is freely available via the website *github*:
    <https://github.com/mauserrifle/simresults>.

    The library is built according to the development method *TDD*, which
    means that use cases of the API have been tested. The API is object
    oriented built and can support multiple simulators with minimal
    modifications.

## Example project

Koopplein.nl
:   **Complete rewrite**

    Koopplein.nl is a digital marketplace where you can trade. My task for this
    project was rebuilding the entire website in a year. Besides developing I
    was also responsible for the project management and managing external
    developers.

    The project has some principles that I still stand behind this day:

    * The website is API-first. API-first forces making decoupled code.

    * The website contains several layers of cache (fallbacks)
    1. Repository cache (PHP)
    2. API cache using HTTP headers (PHP)
    3. Full page cache (PHP)
    4. Proxy cache (NGINX)

    * I used logic-less templates (*Mustache*) to the improve working with
    designers and keep template code maintainable.

	* The project is available in *Vagrant* with the help of
	  *provisioning scripts*.

    With great pride I am eight years responsible for this project.
